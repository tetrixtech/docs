* [Pitaka Feature List](guides/pitaka-feature-list.md)

### Account Management

Pitaka allows user to manage accounts and their keys including hardware wallets, while retaining full control. Pitaka does not store user keys on a single central server.

This feature comes with developer convenience. For developers, you simply interact with the globally available `ethereum` API that identifies the users of web3-compatible browsers and whenever you request a transaction signature (like `eth_sendTransaction` , `ethSignTypedData`, or others).

### Blockchain Connection

Pitaka comes pre-loaded with 25 blockchains. This allows you to get started without synchronizing a full node while still be able to use the blockchain of your choice.

Currently, Pitaka is compatible with [Ethereum-compatible JSON RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API).&#x20;
